        Origins Main article: History of cricket to 1725 A medieval "club ball"
        game involving an underhand bowl towards a batter. Ball catchers are
        shown positioning themselves to catch a ball. Detail from the Canticles
        of Holy Mary, 13th century. Cricket is one of many games in the "club
        ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held
        implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with
        cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games
        category[2]), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table
        tennis.[3] In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a
        solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket
        gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.[4]
        The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club
        ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and fro
        between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is
        driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group",
        in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from
        it".[5] It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's
        game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the
        medieval period.[4] Although there are claims for prior dates, the
        earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence
        given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style), equating
        to January 1598 in the modern calendar. The case concerned ownership of
        a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a
        59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:[6][7][8] Being
        a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his
        fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies. Given
        Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school
        and so it is certain that cricket was being played c. 1550 by boys in
        Surrey.[8] The view that it was originally a children's game is
        reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which
        he defined the noun "crosse" as "the crooked staff wherewith boys play
        at cricket" and the verb form "crosser" as "to play at cricket".[9][10]
        One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word "cryce"
        (or "cricc") meaning a crutch or staff. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary,
        he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick".[6] In Old French, the
        word "criquet" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[11] Given
        the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the
        County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy,
        the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders
        at the time) "krick"(-e), meaning a stick (crook).[11] Another possible
        source is the Middle Dutch worat
        players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at
        county and Test level developed.[45] Cricket becomes an international
        sport The first English team to tour overseas, on board ship to North
        America, 1859 In 1844, the first-ever international match took place
        between what were essentially club teams, from the United States and
        Canada, in Toronto; Canada won.[46][47] In 1859, a team of English
        players went to North America on the first overseas tour.[48] Meanwhile,
        the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas
        and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in
        Australia, the Caribbean, British India (which includes present-day
        Pakistan and Bangladesh), New Zealand, North America and South0, made an immediate impact.[citation
        needed] On 22 June 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the 11th and
        12th ICC full members, enabling them to play Test cricket.[61][62]

    <p style="color:rgb(yellow) ;">
        In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.[63]
        
        Playing area
        Main articles: Cricket field, Cricket pitch, Crease (cricket), and Wicket
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players each.[64] The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of t usually completed in a single day.[69] During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time. The exception to this is if a batter has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run, in this case the batter is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batter hits a scoring run or runs,[72] though this does not apply in international cricket.[73] The order of batters is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.[64]
        
        The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but, in some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batters in their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn.[74] If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have "lost by n runs" (where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have "won by n wickets", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batters have been dismissed) have won the match "by four wickets".[74]

        <p><h4> Main article: Women's cricket</h4>

            Mithali Raj of India, is the highest run scorer in women's international cricket.
            Women's cricket was first recorded in Surrey in 1745.[117] International development began at the start of the 20th century and the first Test Match was played between Australia and England in December 1934.[118] The following year, New Zealand joined them, and in 2007 Netherland became the tenth women's Test nation when they made their debut against South Africa. In 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council was founded (it merged with the ICC in 2005).[118] In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women's World Cup was held in England.[118] In 2005, the International Women's Cricket Council was merged with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket. The ICC Women's Rankings were launched on 1 October 2015 covering all three formats of women's cricket. In October 2018 following the ICC's decision to award T20 International status to all members, the Women's rankings were split into separate ODI (for Full Members) and T20I lists.[119]</p>

        <h1>Governance:</h1>
        <p>The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989.[118] The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can play Test cricket.[120] The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the men's and women's versions of the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.

            Each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team.[121] In the West Indies, which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by Cricket West Indies.[122]</p>
